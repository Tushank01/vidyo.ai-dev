For this project, I utilized JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a dynamic and visually appealing user interface. Leveraging GitHub, I diligently pushed my code to the server and hosted it, ensuring seamless access and collaboration.

One of the notable aspects of my work is its responsiveness across various devices. Through careful design and implementation, users can effortlessly navigate and interact with the application regardless of their device screen size or resolution.

Furthermore, I implemented intuitive user controls, such as a scroller or hover feature, to enable easy switching between different price selection options. Additionally, I integrated a "view all features" button that toggles the display of a comprehensive feature table, enhancing user experience and accessibility.
